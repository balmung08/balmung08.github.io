    With the rapid development of smart port infrastructure, leading ports like Rotterdam and Ningbo have made major strides in automation. However, traditional manual operations at roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) terminals struggle to meet the rising demands for efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and standardization—driven by growing throughput, labor shortages, and increasing operational complexity.<br>
    To address this challenge, we developed and deployed an autonomous robotic transfer system tailored for heavy-duty commercial vehicle handling. The system integrates centimeter-level precise localization and control for vehicle pick-up and drop-off, adaptive multi-mode motion planning and obstacle avoidance based on four-wheel steering (4WS), as well as multi-robot scheduling coordinated with port terminal systems.<br>
    The system was successfully implemented at the Ro-Ro terminal of Yantai Port in Shandong, demonstrating reliable performance under real-world conditions. It achieved over 91% of manual transfer efficiency, operated continuously at 2–3× human working time. These results highlight the feasibility and value of intelligent robotic systems in enhancing Ro-Ro terminal automation.

    Industrial inspection in high-temperature environments such as quenching furnace zones poses significant challenges due to extreme heat, low visibility, and confined operating space. Traditional manual inspections are often inefficient and unsafe, especially under continuous production demands. With the growing push toward intelligent, unmanned factories, there is an urgent need for autonomous systems capable of reliable operation in such harsh industrial settings.<br>
    To address this need, we developed and deployed an autonomous inspection robot specifically designed for quenching furnace environments. The system integrates multi-sensor perception, indoor positioning, and onboard computing to achieve safe, robust, and continuous monitoring. It features RGB-T-based fault detection, enabling effective identification of anomalies under variable lighting and thermal conditions. In addition, a path planning module optimized for narrow and obstacle-dense spaces ensures safe navigation in cluttered industrial layouts. The robot's four-wheel steering (4WS) system supports multiple motion modes, enabling precise trajectory tracking even in constrained environments.<br>
    The robot has demonstrated stable operation in furnace areas, significantly improving inspection reliability, reducing safety risks, and supporting digital transformation efforts in smart manufacturing.
