    With the rapid development of smart port infrastructure, leading ports like Rotterdam and Ningbo are advancing toward greater automation. However, traditional manual operations at roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) terminals are increasingly unable to meet the demands for efficient, cost-effective, and standardized processes—pressured by rising cargo volumes, labor shortages, and operational complexity.<br>
    In response, this project developed an autonomous robotic transfer system specifically designed for handling heavy-duty commercial vehicles in Ro-Ro terminals. The system was deployed at Yantai Port in Shandong Province, where it demonstrated strong performance in real-world operations. Key outcomes include centimeter-level precision in vehicle handling and a transfer efficiency reaching 91% of manual operations, while operating continuously at two to three times the typical manual working time.<br>
    These results highlight the system’s potential to significantly improve the automation level, safety, and efficiency of Ro-Ro terminal operations.
