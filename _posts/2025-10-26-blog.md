    With the rapid development of smart port infrastructure, leading ports like Rotterdam and Ningbo have made major strides in automation. However, traditional manual operations at roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) terminals struggle to meet the rising demands for efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and standardization—driven by growing throughput, labor shortages, and increasing operational complexity.<br>
    To address this challenge, we developed and deployed an autonomous robotic transfer system tailored for heavy-duty commercial vehicle handling. The system integrates centimeter-level precise localization and control for vehicle pick-up and drop-off, adaptive multi-mode motion planning and obstacle avoidance based on four-wheel steering (4WS), as well as multi-robot scheduling coordinated with port terminal systems.<br>
    The system was successfully implemented at the Ro-Ro terminal of Yantai Port in Shandong, demonstrating reliable performance under real-world conditions. It achieved over 91% of manual transfer efficiency, operated continuously at 2–3× human working time. These results highlight the feasibility and value of intelligent robotic systems in enhancing Ro-Ro terminal automation.

var images = ['/pic/1.png', '/pic/1.png', '/pic/1.png'];
var current = 0;
var dots = document.querySelectorAll('span[onclick^="showImage"]');

function showImage(n) {
  current = n;
  document.getElementById('carousel-img').src = images[n];
  dots.forEach((d, i) => d.style.opacity = i === n ? '1' : '0.5');
}

setInterval(() => showImage((current + 1) % 3), 3000);
